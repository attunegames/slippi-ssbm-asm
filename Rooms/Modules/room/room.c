/* The room screen.
 *
 * SKELETON. This is the smallest thing that proves the m-ex pipeline on this
 * branch: the module is found, loaded, relocated, its exports are installed
 * into the scene's Think/Load slots, and it draws. Nothing else yet.
 *
 * Where it is going, so the shape here does not have to be undone later:
 *
 * The room's scene entry is a COPY of the VS splash's (global minor 0x20),
 * not an empty one. That matters. The splash's Load builds two character
 * models in their chosen costumes, and it is the only renderer in the game
 * that does so without a 3D preload the room cannot finish - three attempts
 * at borrowing it the other way are recorded in the old notes, all dead.
 *
 * So this module exports Think and Load and deliberately NOT Leave: m-ex only
 * overwrites a slot a module actually exports, and the copied entry's own
 * Leave is the right one.
 *
 *   Load   fill a match struct we own, call SceneLoad_ClassicModeSplash to
 *          build the characters, then put the room's own text under them
 *   Think  the room's work. Never the splash's own scene think, which is
 *          twelve instructions that do nothing but exit the scene - that is
 *          why the band can sit here indefinitely
 *
 * The band is a function of room state, rebuilt only when that state changes -
 * never per frame. ClassicMode_LoadSplash is callable on its own for exactly
 * that. ⚠️ Whether repeated calls leak is NOT yet known, and this project has
 * been bitten by that before: FN_LoadMatchState allocated and never freed, and
 * calling it per frame killed the room at 36 seconds every time.
